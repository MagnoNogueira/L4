 * File: 	libc.h
 * Purpose: 	Some C library functions to remove dependencies
 *		of the driver on external libraries.
 *
 * The compile-time flag -DRTOS_STRINGS should be used if your RTOS
 * supports the standard <string.h> routines.  The RTOS library or
 * built-in versions of these routines are likely to be much more
 * efficient than the stand-in versions below.
