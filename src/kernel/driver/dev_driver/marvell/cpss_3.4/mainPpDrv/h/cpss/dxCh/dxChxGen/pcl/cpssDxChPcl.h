 * Typedef: struct CPSS_DXCH_PCL_ACTION_VLAN_STC
 *
 * Description:
 *     This structure defines the VLAN modification related Actions.
 *
 * Fields:
 *       modifyVlan  - VLAN id modification command
 *
 *       nestedVlan  -  When this field is set to GT_TRUE, this rule matching
 *                      flow is defined as an access flow. The VID of all
 *                      packets received on this flow is discarded and they
 *                      are assigned with a VID using the device's VID
 *                      assignment algorithms, as if they are untagged. When
 *                      a packet received on an access flow is transmitted via
 *                      a core port or a Cascading port, a VLAN tag is added
 *                      to the packet (on top of the existing VLAN tag, if
 *                      any). The VID field is the VID assigned to the packet
 *                      as a result of all VLAN assignment algorithms. The
 *                      802.1p User Priority field of this added tag may be
 *                      one of the following, depending on the ModifyUP QoS
 *                      parameter set to the packet at the end of the Ingress
 *                      pipe:
 *                      - If ModifyUP is GT_TRUE, it is the UP extracted
 *                      from the QoSProfile to QoS Table Entry<n>
 *                      - If ModifyUP is GT_FALSE, it is the original packet
 *                      802.1p User Priority field if it is tagged and is UP
 *                      if the original packet is untagged.
 *
 *       vlanId      - VLAN id used for VLAN id modification if command
 *                     not CPSS_PACKET_ATTRIBUTE_ASSIGN_DISABLED_E
 *       precedence  - The VLAN Assignment precedence for the subsequent
 *                     VLAN assignment mechanism, which is the Policy engine
 *                     next policy-pass rule. Only relevant if the
 *                     VID precedence set by the previous VID assignment
 *                     mechanisms (Port, Protocol Based VLANs, and previous
 *                     matching rule) is Soft.
 *                     - Soft precedence The VID assignment can be overridden
 *                       by the subsequent VLAN assignment mechanism,
 *                       which is the Policy engine.
 *                     - Hard precedence The VID assignment is locked to the
 *                       last VLAN assigned to the packet and cannot be overridden.

 *                   Only 2 MSBs of pclId are used when portListBmp is used
 *                   (see notes below about portListBmp).

 *                    1 - packet matched by MAC-To-Me lookup, 0 - not matched
 *                   The field relevant only for DxCh3 and above devices.
 *                   DxCh1 and DxCh2 ignore the field
 *     sourcePort  - The port number from which the packet ingressed the device.
 *                   Port 63 is the CPU port.
 *     portListBmp   - Port list bitmap. (APPLICABLE DEVICES: xCat2).
 *                   Relevant only when PCL lookup works in port-list mode.
 *                   In this case the pclId contains two MSB bits only and
 *                   sourcePort field not relevant.
 *                   Only one bit of the portListBmp is set in the key.
 *                   Value of the portListBmp in the key is (1 << srcPort).
 *                   The portListBmp bits in rule's mask and pattern
 *                   should be set to 0 (don't care) for matched ports.
 *                   The portListBmp bits in rule's mask should be 1 and
 *                   pattern should be set to 0 for not matched ports.
 *                   Applying a rule for a packet received from the CPU requires
 *                   the portListBmp pattern with all bits equal to zero. Hence

 *                     to 1 if the packet was received  VLAN or Priority-tagged.
 *                   For Ethernet-Over-xxx tunnel-terminated packets: Passenger

 *                   Passenger packet's VLAN tag format after tag
 *                   addition/removal/modification.
 *                   0 = Packet is untagged.

 *
 *     vid         - VLAN ID assigned to the packet.
 *     up          - The packet's 802.1p User Priority field.
 *     qosProfile  - The QoS Profile assigned to the packet until this lookup

 *                   0 = Non IP packet.
 *                   1 = IPv4/6 packet.
 *     isL2Valid   - Indicates that Layer 2 information in the search key is valid.

 *                   This field can be used by DxCh3 and above device
 *                   application to determinate the Egress PCL key.
 *                   The field should be masked (don't care state) or
 *                   pattern is set to 1 in order to get match by the Egress PCL lookups.
 *                   The Ingress PCL keys of these devices contain
 *                   0-th bit of PCL ID in the position of the valid bit.
 *                   Ingress PCL rules should comprise 0 in the 0-th bit of PCL ID
 *                   in order to avoid match by Egress PCL lookups.
 *                   (APPLICABLE DEVICES: DxCh1, DxCh1_Diamond, DxCh2, DxCh3, xCat, Lion).

 *                  0 = Non IPv6 packet.
 *                  1 = IPv6 packet.
 *     ipProtocol - IP protocol/Next Header type.
 *     dscp       - The DSCP field of the IPv4/6 header.
 *     isL4Valid  - Layer 4 information is valid.
 *                  This field indicates that all the Layer 4
 *                  information required for the search key is available

 *                  - Layer 4 information is not included in the packet.
 *                     For example, Layer 4 information
 *                     isn't available in non-IP packets, or in IPv4
 *                     non-initial-fragments.

 *                     IPv6 extension headers parsing capabilities.
 *                  - IP header is invalid.

 *                  UDP and TCP packets - L4 Header Byte0 through Byte3,
 *                  which contain the UDP/TCP destination and source ports.
 *                  For TCP also L4 Header Byte13, which contains the TCP flags.
 *                  For IGMP L4 Header Byte0, which contain the IGMP Type.
 *                  For ICMP L4 Header Byte0 and Byte1,

*                            Rule index may be in the range from 0 up to 511.
*                          Extended rule consumes the space of two standard

*                            indexes n and n + 512.
*
*                          For DxCh3 device:
*                          The TCAM has up to 3.5K (3584) rows.
*                          See datasheet of particular device for TCAM size.
*                          Each row can be used as:

*                            Rule index may be in the range from 0 up to 7167.
*                            Extended rule consumes the space of two standard
*                            rules:

*                          For example describe the TCAM that has 1/4K (256) rows.
*                          Each row can be used as:
*                              - 4 standard rules

*                          The TCAM partitioning is as follows:
*                          - Standard rules.
*                            Rule index may be in the range from 0 up to 1K (1024).
*                          - Extended rules.
*                            Rule index may be in the range from 0 up to 0.5K (512).
*                            Extended rule consumes the space of two standard
*                            rules:
*                          - Extended rule with index 2n (even index)
*                            is placed in the space of two standard rules with
*                            indexes 4n and 4n + 1.
*                          - Extended rule with index 2n+1 (odd index)
*                            is placed in the space of two standard rules with

*
* DESCRIPTION:
*        The function gets enable/disable state of
*        using port-list in search keys.
*
* APPLICABLE DEVICES:
*        xCat2.
*
* NOT APPLICABLE DEVICES:
*        DxCh1; DxCh1_Diamond; DxCh2; DxCh3; xCat; Lion.
*
* INPUTS:
*    devNum            - device number
*    portGroupsBmp     - bitmap of Port Groups.
*                      NOTEs:
*                       1. for non multi-port groups device this parameter is IGNORED.
*                       2. for multi-port groups device :
*                          bitmap must be set with at least one bit representing
*                          valid port group(s). If a bit of non valid port group
*                          is set then function returns GT_BAD_PARAM.
*                          value CPSS_PORT_GROUP_UNAWARE_MODE_CNS is supported.
*                          - read only from first active port group of the bitmap.
*    direction         - Policy Engine direction, Ingress or Egress
*    lookupNum         - lookup number: 0,1
*    subLookupNum      - Sub lookup Number - for ingress CPSS_PCL_LOOKUP_0_E
*                        means 0: lookup0_0, 1: lookup0_1,
*                        for other cases not relevant.
*
* OUTPUTS:
*    enablePtr         - (pointer to)
*                        GT_TRUE  - enable port-list in search key
*                        GT_FALSE - disable port-list in search key
*
* RETURNS:
*       GT_OK                    - on success
*       GT_BAD_PTR               - on null pointer
*       GT_BAD_PARAM             - on wrong parameters
*       GT_NOT_APPLICABLE_DEVICE - on not applicable device
*       GT_HW_ERROR              - on hardware error
*       GT_FAIL                  - otherwise
