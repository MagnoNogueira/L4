 * Typedef: struct PRV_CPSS_DXCH_NET_INFO_STC
 *
 * Description: A structure to hold all PP data needed on networkIf DXCH layer
 *
 * Fields:
 *     initDone - was the initalization of the networkIf done.
 *                it is needed for 'restart after shutdown' with out HW reset.
 *                because we need to synchronize the PP with the SW regarding
 *                the Rx,Tx descriptors , buffers.
 *     prePendTwoBytesHeader - Enables/Disable pre-pending a two-byte
 *                             header to all packets forwarded to the CPU
 *                             (via the CPU port or the PCI interface).
 *                             This two-byte header is used to align the
 *                             IPv4 header to 32 bits.
 *                             GT_TRUE  - Two-byte header is pre-pended to
 *                                        packets forwarded to the CPU.
 *                             GT_FALSE - Two-byte header is NOT pre-pended
 *                                        to packets forwarded to the CPU.
