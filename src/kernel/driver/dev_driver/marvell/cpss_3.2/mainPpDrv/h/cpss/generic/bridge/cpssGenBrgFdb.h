 *           message from CPU (to PP) - when the CPU wants to get full FDB entry
 *              info about an entry identified by the 'Mac+vid' (key of entry).

 *           1. in DxCh,ExMxPm devices the Index is offset in the bucket
 *                    and not index in the FDB table. (CPU needs to calculate

 *              full FDB entry and the index (offset in the bucket)
 *
 *   GT_AA - aged address (AA) message
 *           message from PP (to CPU) -
 *                  in age with removal : meaning the PP aged out an entry.
 *                  in age without removal : meaning the PP notify the CPU about
 *                      entry that should be aged out.
 *              NOTE: the PP will send those messages also in the process of

 *                    to be aged out.
 *          message from CPU (to PP) - CPU force the PP to invalidate an FDB entry
 *
 *   GT_TA - transplanted address (TA) message.
 *           message from PP (to CPU) - the PP in the process of 'FDB transplanting'
 *                  notify the CPU that an entry transplanted to associate with

 *
 *   GT_SA - security address message
 *           message from PP (to CPU)-
