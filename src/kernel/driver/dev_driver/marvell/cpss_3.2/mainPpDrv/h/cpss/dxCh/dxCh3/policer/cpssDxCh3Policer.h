* DESCRIPTION:
*       CPSS DxCh3 Policing Engine API and above.
*       The Policing Engine (or Traffic Conditioner) is responsible for:
*           - Ingress Metering - implemented using SrTCM Token Bucket,
*             TrTCM Token Bucket and Two Color Mode algorithms.
*           - Egress Metering - implemented for DxChXcat and above devices
*           - Ingress Billing - byte/packet counters that keep track of amount
*             of traffic belonging to a flow.
*           - Egress Billing - implemented for DxChXcat and above devices
*             Re-Marking - QoS assigned to the packet according to metering
*             results.
*
* FILE REVISION NUMBER:
*       $Revision: 9 $

*       mis-interpreted and the incoming packet is marked as non-conforming
*       even though the bucket was actually supposed to be full.
*       To prevent this from happening the CPU needs to trigger a meter

*
* DESCRIPTION:
*       Flush internal Write Back Cache (WBC) of counting entries.
*       The Policer implements internal Write Back Cache for frequent and rapid
*       update of counting entries.
*       Since the WBC holds the policer entries' data, the CPU must clear its
*       content when performing direct write access of the counting entries by
*       one of following functions:
*        - cpssDxCh3PolicerBillingEntrySet
*        - cpssDxChPolicerVlanCntrSet
*        - cpssDxChPolicerPolicyCntrSet
*       The policer counting should be disabled before flush of WBC if direct
*       write access is performed under traffic. And policer counting should be
*       enabled again after finish of write access.
*       The cpssDxChPolicerCountingModeSet may be used to disable/enable
*       the policer counting.
