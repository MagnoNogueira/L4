/**
 * Typedef: enum PRV_CPSS_DXCH_ERRATA_ENT
 *
 * Description: enumerator for the numbers of Erratum that handles in the CPSS
 *              code
 *
 * Fields:
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH_FDB_AGING_WITH_REMOVAL_MODE_WA_E - In FDB Aging with removal
 *              mode, AA messages are sent for entries removed due to an
 *              invalid device.
 *              The CPU should ignore those messages, after ensuring that the
 *              DeviceId is invalid
 *              (FEr#22)
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH_TRUNK_CONFIG_FOR_TRUNK_NEXT_HOP_WA_E - When the Next Hop is a
 *              trunk, the router sets the TrunkHash in the descriptor to
 *              PktHash[2:0]. This means that the value of the TrunkHash may be
 *              set to any value: 0 through 7.
 *              If the Next Hop is a trunk with less than 8 members,
 *              the device may fetch an invalid trunk member.
 *              (FEr#137)
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH_INCORRECT_SRCDEV_FIELD_IN_MAILBOX_TO_CPU_DSA_TAG_WA_E -
 *              by Copy The mailbox mechanism enables implementation of a
 *              topology discovery algorithm in a stacking system.
 *              A FROM_CPU DSA-tagged packet with a mailbox indication is
 *              reformatted as a TO_CPU DSA-tagged packet and is forwarded
 *              to the host CPU.
 *              Unlike other TO_CPU DSA-tagged packets, in which the SrcPort and
 *              SrcDev fields preserve their value as it was originally set in
 *              the DSA tag, in a mailbox TO_CPU DSA tag, the SrcPort is set to
 *              the local device Source port number (at which the FROM_CPU DSA-
 *              tagged packet with a mailbox indication was received) and the
 *              SrcDev field is set to the local device number. However, due to
 *              this erratum, the SrcDev field is not set to the local device
 *              number.
 *              (FEr#6)
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH_TOKEN_BUCKET_RATE_SHAPING_DISABLE_WA_E  -
 *              Disabling the Egress Rate Shaper under traffic may hang its
 *              relevant transmit queue.
 *              To disable the Egress Rate Shaper follow the following procedure:
 *              1. Set MaxBucketSize to 0xFFF, Tokens to 0xFFF, SlowRateEn to 0.
 *              2. Set TokenBucketEn to 0.
 *              (FEr#47)
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH_JUMBO_FRAMES_MODE_SDWRR_WEIGHT_LIMITATION_WA_E  -
 *              The transmit queue Shaped Deficit Weighted Round Robin (SDWRR)
 *              weight may be configured from 0 through 255,
 *              corresponding to a weight of 1 through 256 respectively.
 *              However, due to this erratum, in Jumbo frames mode the maximal
 *              weight that may be configured is 254.
 *              (FEr#29)
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH_PACKET_ORIG_BYTE_COUNT_WA_E -
 *              All packets forwarded to the CPU are forwarded with a
 *              TO_CPU DSA tag. One of the fields in this tag is <PktOrigBC>.
 *              However, when a packet forwarded to the CPU is from another
 *              device, it gets the packet's byte count as it enters the second
 *              device and not the original byte count of the packet that was
 *              received on the first device. The <PktOrigBC> will be either
 *              four or eight bytes larger than the received packet's byte count,
 *              according to the DSA tag that was added.
 *              (FEr#89)
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH_RATE_LIMIT_GIG_COUNTER_BITS_NUM_WA_E -
 *              When the value of the 1000MWindow field, in the Ingress Rate
 *              limit Configuration Register0 is higher than 31, the rate limit
 *              does not work properly.
 *              The byte/packets counter of the rate limit (in ports that were
 *              rate limit enabled) never return to zero, causing the bridge to
 *              drop all traffic from these ports.
 *              (FEr#140)
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH_XG_MIB_READ_OVERSIZE_AND_JABBER_COUNTERS_WA_E -
 *              Counters 24 (oversize) and 25 (jabber) in XG MIBs, which are
 *              placed in one entry, are treated as one long 64-bit counter.
 *              Therefore, when any one of them is read, counter 24 will always
 *              be accessed. Any additional read, even for another counter,
 *              will then access counter 25.
 *              (FEr#85)
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH_FER_FDB_AUQ_LEARNING_AND_SCANING_DEADLOCK_WA_E -
*              in some cases when performing scanning operations and the AUQ is
*              full the learning operation is also stalled.
*              The reason is:
*              the learning and scanning machines share an access arbiter.
*              In order to insure data coherency in the FDB only a one of
*              the clients s allowed to access the FDB at any given time.
*              An access being with a read and ends with a write and only
*              then is the arbitration changed.
*              In the scenario you saw, since the scanning machine is
*              waiting for the AUQ to become available, it does not release
*              the access arbiter.
*              The learning machine in this case is stalled as well and is
*              waiting for the scanning machine to release the access arbiter.
 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH2_READ_SRC_ID_ASSIGMENT_MODE_CONF_REG_WA_E -
 *              To assign non-DSA tagged packets with a source-ID according to
 *              the port default configuration (ignoring the source FDB entry
 *              Source-ID assignment), set the corresponding port bit in the
 *              field in the Source-ID Assignment Mode Configuration register.
 *              However, due to this erratum, when reading from this register,
 *              wrong data is returned.
 *              (FEr#1084)
 *   PRV_CPSS_DXCH2_BRIDGE_ACCESS_MATRIX_LINE7_WRITE_WA_E  -
 *              Bridge Access Matrix Line <7> register is write only.
 *              Shadow of the register should be used by SW.
 *              (FEr#1006)
 *   PRV_CPSS_DXCH2_POLICY_ACTION_DIRECT_BURST_ONLY_READ_WA_E -
 *              Direct access and indirect access to tables is supported
 *              by the device. However, due to this erratum, direct access
 *              to the Policy Action entry table,
 *              (address space: 0x0B8C0000 - 0x0B8C3FFC) is not supported
 *              for single access. (burst only). (FEr#1090)
 *
 *   PRV_CPSS_DXCH2_DIRECT_ACCESS_TO_POLICER_ADDRESS_SPACE_WA_E -
 *              Direct access to policer engine address space is not functional
 *              WA : The policer engine registers and tables, address space,
 *              0x0C000000 - 0x0C800000, must be accessed by using the indirect
 *              access mechanism, as specified in the device's Functional
 *              Specifications Doc. No. MV-S103086-00.
 *              (FEr#1001)
 *   PRV_CPSS_DXCH2_ROUTER_ARP_AND_TS_TABLE_NOT_SUPPORT_BURST_ACCESS_VIA_PCI_WA_E -
 *              Router ARP and Tunnel Start table do not support burst access via PCIõ
 *              The device supports burst reads from its internal memory address
 *              space. However, due to this erratum, the Router Address
 *              Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Tunnel Start (TS) table,
 *              0x07E80000 - 0x07E87FF4, cannot be accessed by using the burst
 *              access feature.
 *              WA : Access to the Router ARP and TS table must done by single
 *              32-bit read/write access.
 *              (FEr#1003)
 *   PRV_CPSS_DXCH2_RDWRTRIG_BIT_IN_VLT_TABLES_ACCESS_CONTROL_REGISTER_IGNORED_E -
 *              RdWrTrig, bit[15] in the VLT Tables Access Control register is ignored.
 *              When the RdWrTrig field, bit[15] in the VLT Tables Access
 *              Control register (offset: 0x0A000010) is set to 1, a read or
 *              write command is performed. After the action is completed, this
 *              bit is cleared. However, due to this erratum, a read or write
 *              command is performed for every write access to the register,
 *              regardless of the value of the RdWrTrig field.
 *              WA : No dummy write commands should be done to the VLT Tables
 *              Access Control register (offset: 0x0A000010).
 *              (FEr#1007)
 *   PRV_CPSS_DXCH2_INDIRECT_ACCESS_ROUTER_AND_TT_TCAM_NOT_FUNCTION_CORRECTLY_WA_E -
 *              Indirect access for Router and Tunnel Termination (TT) TCAM does
 *              not function correctly.
 *              The device supports indirect access to the Router and Tunnel
 *              Termination (TT) table. Valid bits should be written to the
 *              arrays according to their location: Valid[0] to Array0, Valid[1]
 *              to Array1, etc. However, due to this erratum, this does not
 *              function correctly. So when writing to one array, set all bits
 *              to 1 to validate the entry, or all bits to 0 to invalidate the
 *              entry. Do the same for writing to all arrays in parallel.
 *              WA: When using the indirect access mechanism to access the Router
 *              and Tunnel termination (TT) table bits[4:0], the Valid field,
 *              bits[4:0] in the Router and TT TCAM Access Data Control register
 *              (offset: 0x02800418), must be set to the same value, either 0x0
 *              to invalidate or 0x1F to validate.
 *              An additional option is to use the direct access mechanism to
 *              access the Router and Tunnel termination (TT) table.
 *              (FEr#1062)
 *   PRV_CPSS_DXCH_RM_XG_PHY_PATH_FAILURE_WA_E -
 *              XG PHY path failure.Wrong value of PHY register 0xFF34.
 *              WA: The following register write sequence should be performed
 *              after power-up, reset or after XG PHY power-up: FF00, FF00, and

 *  PRV_CPSS_DXCH3_SDMA_WA_E -
 *              SDMA resource errors may cause PCI Express packets reception
 *              malfunction.
 *              When using the PCI Express host management interface
 *              for forwarding packets to/from the host CPU, the
 *              CPU receives packets from the device directly to
 *              a pre-allocated space in the host memory. To
 *              receive packets for a given CPU traffic class
 *              queue, the CPU prepares a linked list of
 *              descriptors located in the host memory. A
 *              resource error event occurs when it reaches the
 *              end of available descriptors in the linked list.
 *              This resource error occurs if either: The
 *              current descriptor for the Rx SDMA has a NULL
 *              next-descriptor pointer. OR The SDMA has reached
 *              a descriptor that is owned by the CPU (i.e., a
 *              cyclic descriptor list is implemented). This may
 *              happen at the start of a packet or in the middle
 *              of writing a packet to host memory (if it
 *              occupies more than a single descriptor buffer).
 *              This may also happen due to a speculative
 *              pre-fetch of a descriptor (i.e, without any
 *              current packet destined to the given queue). The
 *              device terminates packet writing to the host
 *              memory if it reaches the end of the linked list
 *              before completion of packet reception.Functional
